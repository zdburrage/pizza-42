# Pizza 42 SPA

This sample app demonstrates the integration of the [Auth0 Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) into an Angular application created using the Angular CLI. This sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Angular SDK Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular).

This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- Login
- Log out
- Showing the user profile
- Protecting routes using the authentication guard
- Calling APIs with automatically-attached bearer tokens

## Development server

Run `ng serve --port 8080` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
